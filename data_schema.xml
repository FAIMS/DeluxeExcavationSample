        <term>{3.Possibly_Contaminated} 
        <description>At Boncuklu as at many sites there is significant animal activity represented by burrows. We aim to remove most animal burrow fill. This is easier in contexts with clear and compact sediment characteristics like plaster floors walls building fills more difficult in loose middens. In one sense at Boncuklu as at many sites every context is possibly contaminated but there would be little point in indicating that since it is something we generally understand. Therefore this option is to be
        used to indicate those situations where one may have tried to remove animal introduced or other contamination but are unsure this has been successful and there is a likely but not definitive chance of some later contamination beyond. This option also applies where there may have been later cuts not recognised but we are not sure.</description></term>
        <term>{4.High_Likely_Contaminated} 
        <description>It is very likely that significant amounts of earlier artifact and ecofact material has become incorporated in the deposit. For example; is this context a mud brick wall or other structure or building or structural debris or a deposit which has seen the redeposition of material excavated from cuts. These are all situations in which earlier material is likely to have been dug up and re-used (in the mud brick) or re-deposited (when digging out pits).</description></term>

      <description>Describe the sides in terms of their smoothness or irregularity and state whether they are 'vertical' 'convex' 'concave' or 'stepped' giving details for each side of a multi-sided cut. When describing post-holes note particularly whether the sides taper or drop vertically to the base since this may help define whether the post was set or driven. Where possible state the gradient of a sloping side. Where the side is 'concave' but meets the base at a sharp angle give an overall gradient.
      If' it is 'concave' and has no perceptible break of slope with the base then do not attempt to give a gradient. (Source: MoLAS 1994)</description>
